# DZlearnWords
A simple program, which allows you to learn new words / phrases of the language you desire to learn.
It's meant to be used under Debian/Ubuntu based desktop systems.

It's not bound to any language, you can freely learn even other things using that.
The source information for learning (the list of things to learn) is defined by you in advance
(a simple .txt file with words and translations for e.g.).

The main approach picked out here, is to give you a possibility to focus on your work,
meanwhile the program between-times pops up (with a random time step) and shows you some word
from the list of words (which you previously prepared), and then you can either set it as learned
or set this as a forgotten word/phrase.

In the end of the program run you get the summary of what you have learned so far,
and what has been left to repeat again.

The main idea is, that your brain faster learns, in case the material to repeat/learn appears
randomly, and you have to quickly answer (retrieve the information from your mind).
Hence after several iterations of the same list of words, you can quickly achieve the target.

Remark: please take into account, this program is under constant development and
perhaps will be not the best fit for your wishes,
feel free to report any problems and/or provide new ideas.
